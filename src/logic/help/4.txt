Add a recurring task
Enter “add”, followed by the title of the task, an interval, an optional date/time and an optional termination condition.

The syntax for the individual components is:
(a)	Interval
	- every <optional number of times> <frequency> 
	- Frequency refers to any day of the week, “days”, “weeks”, “months” and “years”
(b)	Termination condition
	i.	until <date time>
	ii.	for <number of times> <frequency>
		- Frequency refers to “times”, “days”, “weeks”, “months” and “years”

If there is no specified termination condition, the task is known as an infinitely recurring task. 
The program will maintain a maximum of 10 occurrences for the task based on the interval.

If there is no specified start date, it will be default to today’s date.

- add <task title> <interval> <optional date time> <optional termination condition>
