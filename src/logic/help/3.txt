3.	Viewing/Searching for an existing event/task using task description

Enter any of the following: “view”, “find”, “search”, “display”, “list”, followed by the search keywords. The search keywords should contain at least one word from the task description, although the search terms do not have to be case-sensitive. 

The program will display a list of events/tasks that matches the search terms, sorted in order of time. If there are no tasks matching the search terms, the software will display “No tasks found”.

Please note that entering only the command without any search terms displays all events/tasks, sorted in order of time.

Usage Examples: 
view dinner	Searches and displays all tasks, events and deadlines including the word “dinner”, non case-sensitive.
view Project	Searches and displays all tasks, events and deadlines including the word “Project”, non case-sensitive.
