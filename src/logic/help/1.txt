1.	Adding a new event/floating task: 
You can add a new event/floating task to be tracked by the program. 

Enter “add”, followed by the event/floating task description. The start and end date time can also be included with the event/floating task and the information will automatically be added to the event details.

Note that if two conflicting events are scheduled (i.e. The timing of the event to be scheduled overlaps with any part of any existing event), there will be a notification requesting you to confirm if these two events are to be scheduled together despite the conflict. 

Usage Examples:
add Dinner with John 7pm - 8pm	Creates an event named “Dinner with John”, scheduled between 7pm to 8pm on the day this was created
add Dinner with John	Creates a floating task named “Dinner with John”
