2.	Adding a new deadline:

Tasks with a deadline can also be added by using the command “by” followed by an indication of a date after the task description. The date indicated can be flexible in its format, such as keying in the exact date or simply something like “next Tuesday”. Examples are provided below.

Note that tasks without any deadlines written will be automatically added as a floating task. 

Usage Examples:
add Complete Assignment 1 by next Monday	Creates a deadline for “Complete Assignment 1” with due date on the Monday of the next week
add Complete Project Report by 25 Feb		Creates a deadline for “Complete Project Report”, with due date on the nearest 25 February in the future (If task was added on 26 February 2015, due date will be 25 February 2016)
